            <h1>About Me!</h1>
            <p> Hi! My name's Minh, an aspiring Front-End Engineer! For a little introduction about myself, I was a UCLA student studying Neuroscience 
            <br>up until the Summer of 2022, where I decided to come back to my hometown of Santa Rosa to study Computer Science and Web Development!
            <br>I'm hoping to become a Full-Stack engineer at some point in the future, but for right now the visual feedback that comes from UI/UX Design
            <br>makes me want to pursue that field in the mean time!

            <h1> My Interests</h1>
            <p>
                For what I'm up to besides pursuing a web development career, I'm pretty into exercise in general. Right now I'm taking Muay Thai classes, <br>
                and I go to the gym and play basketball whenever I can find time. I love gaming - I don't love talking about how much time I spent playing <br>
                CS:GO when I was younger - whether that be in the form of board games or video games. Settlers of Catan is probably my favorite board game, <br>
                while Hollow Knight and Monster Hunter World are a couple of my favorite video games.
            </p>
